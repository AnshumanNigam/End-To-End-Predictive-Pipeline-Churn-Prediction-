# End-To-End-Predictive-Pipeline-Churn-Prediction

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

The primary objective of this project is to determine which model (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, etc.) is most effective for predicting customer churn and to build an end-to-end predictive pipeline.

This project has 2 parts-
- First part reimplements a research paper that helps us to identify the best model for the prediction.
- The second part focuses on building an end-to-end predictive pipeline for Churn prediction.

**Why is customer churn a major factor in various industries?**

Customer churn impacts revenue and loyalty, as retaining customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones. Predicting churn helps companies take targeted actions in competitive markets.
